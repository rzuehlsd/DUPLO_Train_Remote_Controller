## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements a robust, multi-layered, event-driven train controller for LEGO DUPLO trains. The firmware builds on top of the open-source [Legoino](https://github.com/JorgePe/legoino) library created by Jorge Pereira ("JorgePe"), reusing its Powered Up protocol support while adding a hardened hardware abstraction tailored to ESP32 dual-core devices.

Key pillars of the solution include:

- **ESP32 dual-core architecture** (FreeRTOS): BLE communication runs independently from application logic for deterministic responsiveness.
- **Legoino-powered protocol stack**: Proven LEGO Powered Up discovery, device activation, and message parsing.
- **Thread-safe command and sensor queues**: Bidirectional, non-blocking communication between BLE and main application tasks.
- **Automatic connection management**: Self-healing BLE connections with exponential backoff recovery.
- **Professional logging and monitoring**: Real-time status, error, and performance reporting.

The high-level structure is summarised below; a deeper dive is available in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🌟 User Experience Highlights

These are the moments a driver or parent actually notices while using the controller—zero jargon, just playtime impressions.

- **Switch on & go:** Power the ESP32 and the DUPLO hub, wait a heartbeat, and the status LED glows green to confirm the train is connected and ready.
- **Throttle feel:** The rotary knob behaves like a miniature train throttle—smooth acceleration when you turn right, gentle braking when you back off, with a centre notch for easy stops.
- **Instant atmosphere:** Dedicated buttons trigger horn blasts, brake squeals, and refill sounds on cue, turning simple loops into storytelling sessions.
- **Colour-coded surprises:** Placing red, yellow, blue, or white tiles on the track triggers matching actions (emergency stop, horn, refill pause, celebration flashes) for interactive play without touching the controller.
- **Showtime replay:** Capture a favourite run once, then play it back later to wow an audience or keep kids entertained with a predictable routine.
- **Clear safety cues:** Emergency stops bathe the hub LED in red and keep the train still until you deliberately resume, giving guardians peace of mind.
- **Sleep when you do:** After a quiet spell the controller nods off, conserving power, and wakes instantly with a tap—perfect for exhibitions or classrooms.
- **Friendly status feedback:** Periodic console messages and LED hints explain what’s happening (“searching,” “replaying,” “sleeping”) so you never guess at the system state.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The firmware is organised into three cooperating layers:

1. **Application Layer (`TrainController`)** – orchestrates user input, status LED feedback, replay/record logic, and system health checks.
2. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (`DuploHub`)** – maintains thread-safe command/response queues, sensors, and lifecycle management for the BLE task.
3. **Protocol Layer (`myLegoHub`/Legoino)** – bridges to the LEGO Powered Up protocol, handling device discovery and low-level message encoding.

These layers communicate exclusively through FreeRTOS queues and callbacks, which allows the BLE task and user interface to stay decoupled. The full architectural description, sequence diagrams, and performance considerations are documented in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## ⚙️ Dual-Core Strategy

The ESP32’s two cores are used deliberately to isolate time-critical communication from user-driven workloads:

- **Core 0** is dedicated to the BLE stack (NimBLE) and the `DuploHub` task, guaranteeing consistent connection upkeep and sensor polling under tight timing constraints.
- **Core 1** runs the Arduino loop (`TrainController`), handling rotary encoder updates, button ladders, response queue processing, and visual/audible feedback without blocking the BLE stack.

This separation keeps latency predictable—even when the UI is busy—and prevents sensor interrupts or sound/LED routines from starving the communication pipeline.

## Future Improvements

- Small Duplo Train Controller based on ESP32-S3 with integrated batterie management
- small Lithium Batterie
- Instead of Poti use of rotary encoder
- Function to record actions and play back (Buttons Rec, Play)
- small Duplo sized printed housing
- only 3 Buttons to control LED, sound and emergency stop
- Function to pair with train (store ID and use when connecting)

3. **Demo**: Once connected, the demo sequence begins automatically
4. **Monitoring**: Status information is displayed every 10 seconds

### Expected Serial Output

```text
TrainController: Starting up...
DuploHub: FreeRTOS objects initialized
DuploHub: BLE task started successfully
TrainController: Ready - BLE task running, waiting for hub connection...
BLE Task: Started successfully
BLE Task: Attempting initial connection to hub...
BLE Task: Connected to HUB
TrainController: Hub connected - initializing train demo!
TrainController: Starting train demo sequence...
TrainController Status - BLE Task: Running, Hub Connected: Yes, Demo Active: Yes
```

### Demo Sequence

The system runs a continuous demonstration:

1. **LED Green** → **LED Red** → **Motor Forward** → **Stop** → **Motor Backward** → **Stop** → **Repeat**
2. Each step lasts 1 second
3. Demo stops automatically if hub disconnects
4. Demo resumes automatically when reconnected

## 🎛️ User Interaction & LED Feedback

| Interaction | Description | Hub Response | Status LED Feedback |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Rotary encoder turn | Adjusts desired train speed in ±5 steps | Issues `setMotorSpeed()` with normalized value or stops within the dead zone | None (hub LED reflects chosen colour elsewhere) |
| Rotary encoder press | Logged when connected (reserved for future shortcuts) | Diagnostic log entry only | None |
| Record button | Toggles command capture session | Starts/stops `DuploHub::recordCommands()` and clears replay flags | Blinks **blue** while recording, off when idle |
| Play button | Toggles replay of the last recorded session | Invokes `DuploHub::replayCommands()` / `stopReplay()` | Blinks **yellow** during playback, off when idle |
| Stop button | Acts as emergency stop or cancels replay | Stops the motor, plays brake sound, resets replay state | Solid **red** when emergency stop active, off otherwise |
| Light button | Cycles DUPLO hub LED colours | Sends `setLedColor()` with the next palette entry | Hub LED changes colour (status LED unchanged) |
| Sound button | Steps through horn / brake / station samples | Calls `playSound()` with the next sound ID (skips refill) | None |
| Water button | Triggers the refill routine | Plays water refill sound and prepares LED transitions | None |
| Idle timeout (~30 s) | No user input for the configured window | Calls `esp_deep_sleep_start()` | Brief status flash before sleep |

Colour sensor events provide additional automation:

- **Red tile** toggles the emergency stop, forces the hub LED red, blinks the status LED red, and plays the brake sound.
- **Yellow tile** plays the horn while pulsing both LEDs yellow.
- **Blue tile** pauses the train, plays the refill sound, then restores the last commanded speed.
- **White tile** flashes both LEDs white three times as a checkpoint signal.
- **Black tile** restores a neutral state by setting both LEDs to black.

These interaction rules are processed via `DuploHub::processResponseQueue()` using the colour stability timer described in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🔄 How Sensor Processing Works

When a DUPLO color sensor detects a color change, here's how it flows through the system:

```text
1. DUPLO Sensor    →  2. BLE Radio    →  3. ESP32 Core 0
   Detects RED        Transmits data     NimBLE + Lpf2Hub
4. Static Callback →  5. Sensor Queue  →  6. ESP32 Core 1
   Parse + Package     FreeRTOS Queue     Main Task Processing
7. User Callback   →  8. Motor Command →  9. BLE Command
   onColorDetected     stopMotor()         Back to DUPLO Hub
```

- **Total Time:** ~75ms from sensor detection to motor response

---

## 🎮 How Motor Control Works

When you call `duploHub.setMotorSpeed(50)`, here's how it flows through the system:

```text
1. Application     →  2. Thread-Safe   →  3. Command Queue
   setMotorSpeed(50)  Wrapper Function     FreeRTOS Queue
4. ESP32 Core 1    →  5. ESP32 Core 0   →  6. Protocol Format
   Main Task Queue    BLE Task Processing   Lpf2Hub + LEGO Protocol
7. BLE Transmission → 8. DUPLO Hub     →  9. Motor Hardware
   NimBLE + Radio      Protocol Parse     PWM Signal to Motor
```

- **Total Time:** ~60ms from function call to physical motor response

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Connection Problems
- Ensure DUPLO hub is powered on and in pairing mode
- Check if hub is already connected to another device
- Reset hub by holding button for 10 seconds
- Move ESP32 closer to hub (within 5 meters)

#### Task Failures
- Check available heap memory: `ESP.getFreeHeap()`
- Reduce other running tasks
- Increase stack size in `startBLETask()`

#### Command Delays
- Check command queue status
- Verify BLE connection stability
- Reduce command frequency in application

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed debugging by adding to `platformio.ini`:

```ini
build_flags = -DCORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=4
monitor_filters = esp32_exception_decoder
```
