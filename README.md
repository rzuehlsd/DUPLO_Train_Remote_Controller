## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements a robust, multi-layered, event-driven train controller for LEGO DUPLO trains. It leverages:

- **ESP32 dual-core architecture** (FreeRTOS): BLE and application logic run on separate cores for maximum responsiveness.
- **Legoino library**: LEGO Powered Up protocol and device abstraction.
- **Thread-safe command and sensor queues**: Bidirectional, non-blocking communication between BLE and main application tasks.
- **Automatic connection management**: Self-healing BLE connections and error recovery.
- **Professional logging and monitoring**: Real-time status, error, and performance reporting.

For a detailed technical breakdown, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Future Improvements

- Small Duplo Train Controller based on ESP32-S3 with integrated batterie management
- small Lithium Batterie
- Instead of Poti use of rotary encoder
- Function to record actions and play back (Buttons Rec, Play)
- small Duplo sized printed housing
- only 3 Buttons to control LED, sound and emergency stop
- Function to pair with train (store ID and use when connecting)

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Startup**: System automatically starts and begins scanning for DUPLO hubs
2. **Connection**: When hub is found, automatic connection is established
3. **Demo**: Once connected, the demo sequence begins automatically
4. **Monitoring**: Status information is displayed every 10 seconds

### Expected Serial Output

```text
TrainController: Starting up...
DuploHub: FreeRTOS objects initialized
DuploHub: BLE task started successfully
TrainController: Ready - BLE task running, waiting for hub connection...
BLE Task: Started successfully
BLE Task: Attempting initial connection to hub...
BLE Task: Connected to HUB
TrainController: Hub connected - initializing train demo!
TrainController: Starting train demo sequence...
TrainController Status - BLE Task: Running, Hub Connected: Yes, Demo Active: Yes
```

### Demo Sequence

The system runs a continuous demonstration:

1. **LED Green** → **LED Red** → **Motor Forward** → **Stop** → **Motor Backward** → **Stop** → **Repeat**
2. Each step lasts 1 second
3. Demo stops automatically if hub disconnects
4. Demo resumes automatically when reconnected

## 🔄 How Sensor Processing Works

When a DUPLO color sensor detects a color change, here's how it flows through the system:

```text
1. DUPLO Sensor    →  2. BLE Radio    →  3. ESP32 Core 0
   Detects RED        Transmits data     NimBLE + Lpf2Hub
4. Static Callback →  5. Sensor Queue  →  6. ESP32 Core 1
   Parse + Package     FreeRTOS Queue     Main Task Processing
7. User Callback   →  8. Motor Command →  9. BLE Command
   onColorDetected     stopMotor()         Back to DUPLO Hub
```

- **Total Time:** ~75ms from sensor detection to motor response

---

## 🎮 How Motor Control Works

When you call `duploHub.setMotorSpeed(50)`, here's how it flows through the system:

```text
1. Application     →  2. Thread-Safe   →  3. Command Queue
   setMotorSpeed(50)  Wrapper Function     FreeRTOS Queue
4. ESP32 Core 1    →  5. ESP32 Core 0   →  6. Protocol Format
   Main Task Queue    BLE Task Processing   Lpf2Hub + LEGO Protocol
7. BLE Transmission → 8. DUPLO Hub     →  9. Motor Hardware
   NimBLE + Radio      Protocol Parse     PWM Signal to Motor
```

- **Total Time:** ~60ms from function call to physical motor response

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Connection Problems
- Ensure DUPLO hub is powered on and in pairing mode
- Check if hub is already connected to another device
- Reset hub by holding button for 10 seconds
- Move ESP32 closer to hub (within 5 meters)

#### Task Failures
- Check available heap memory: `ESP.getFreeHeap()`
- Reduce other running tasks
- Increase stack size in `startBLETask()`

#### Command Delays
- Check command queue status
- Verify BLE connection stability
- Reduce command frequency in application

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed debugging by adding to `platformio.ini`:

```ini
build_flags = -DCORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=4
monitor_filters = esp32_exception_decoder
```
